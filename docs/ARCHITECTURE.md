# Dispatch service architecture

Status: accepted foundation direction

## Decision

Dispatch uses small, independently runnable services. The repository is a delivery container, not a runtime monolith.

```text
Browser or Tauri WebKit
        |
        +---- dispatch-mail :8411
        |         owns message and draft projections
        |
        +---- dispatch-agent :8412
                  owns codex app-server lifecycle
                            |
                            +---- codex app-server over JSONL stdio
                                      |
                                      +---- installed apps/connectors
```

## Boundaries

### Web

`dispatch-web` owns presentation state only. It does not infer mail priority, synthesize agent results, hold credentials, spawn processes, or read provider storage.

### Mail

`dispatch-mail` owns browser-facing conversation, message, and draft view models. It calls the agent service's typed, read-only Gmail adapter, retrieves each connector account, groups messages by account plus Gmail thread ID, merges conversation projections by source time, and converts Gmail headers and MIME parts into safe view models. It owns All, Unread, and Read filter semantics. An explicit in-memory demo provider remains available when no connector account is present. Gmail writes are not enabled.

### Agent

`dispatch-agent` is the only service that starts and communicates with Codex App Server. It exposes a small HTTP and server-sent-event adapter for account state, installed apps, threads, turns, and streamed items. It does not implement a model loop.

The browser persists the current Codex thread ID. After an agent-service restart, it resumes that thread through App Server before reopening the event stream. If App Server is temporarily unavailable, the browser shows `Reconnecting` and retries. It does not report a disconnected stream as connected.

## SimpleMark reuse

The foundation reuses SimpleMark's established choices rather than its product domain:

- Vite and strict TypeScript.
- WebKit-compatible HTML and CSS.
- restrained native-window visual language;
- rendered-document typography;
- explicit light and dark themes;
- sanitization before rendering provider HTML;
- thin platform composition;
- browser acceptance tests;
- private canonical repository plus public verification sandbox.

The source reference inspected for this bootstrap was SimpleMark `8a38e012089dd5b81a71a176056134d0a6d68dda`.

## Local transport

Browser development uses localhost HTTP and SSE. The macOS shell will start the same services as bundled sidecars and use loopback or Unix-domain transport. Codex App Server remains on its supported local `stdio` transport.

## Failure behavior

- Mail failure leaves the mail panel in a visible failed state.
- Cached mail is labeled with its age while a refresh is active. A failed refresh keeps the provider error visible and never presents stale data as current.
- Missing or invalid provider fields fail normalization instead of silently becoming read, empty, or current values.
- Agent failure leaves email readable and shows Codex as unavailable.
- App Server restart does not fabricate successful turns.
- Demo mail is visibly labeled and never presented as Gmail evidence.
